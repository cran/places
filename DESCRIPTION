Description: Clusters GPS coordinates into places (i.e., meaningful stops). Additionally, categorizes places into types (e.g., home, cafe, gym). Places are identified as home using a rules-based algorithm defining home as the stop occurring most frequently during the night. Other places (e.g., cafe, gym) are identified using the Google Maps API.
